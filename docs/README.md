## Circuitpython Firmware

The regular rp2040 firmware works, but needs a dedicated driver for the display. With the firmware for the T-Display rp2040 the display works, but this firmware currently misses a PID to be published. And the RX, TX, CTS and RTS pins have to be assigned specifically. An independent build for the T-PicoC3 would be beneficial.
